## Main features

1. [React 15.4.2](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - JS library for building UI
1. [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - awesome React starter with only one dependency (among others, it uses  Webpack, Babel, ESLint)
2. [custom-react-scripts](https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts) - fork of CRA (↑) that enables you to turn on Sass, Less, Stylus or CSS Modules support without running ```npm run eject```

4. [react-router 3.0.2](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
5. [reselect 2.5.4](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) - simple “selector” library for Redux
6. [Redux 3.6.0](http://redux.js.org/) - state container for JavaScript apps
7. [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) - as a type checker for JS
8. [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) - test runner
9. [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) - to enable redux debugging (please install also [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd) to use it)

### Usage
1. ```npm start``` to start development server
2. Open your browser on ```http://localhost:3000```
